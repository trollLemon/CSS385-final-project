                As a team we came together around an idea very quickly. 
                We were enthusiastic about this idea and quickly created features to work on. 
                We broke those features up among ourselves and made sure to have something completed before each Wednesday. 
                This is evident by our gradual progress made in each of our WebGL builds that are linked on our GitHub page. 
                We also believe that our game has a very unified look and feel that we are proud of. 
                A unified feel is difficult to capture and can be seen and experienced when playing our game.

                If we had another two weeks we would want to fix and implement a multitude of features. 
                The first thing we would address is our missing crafting animation. 
                When crafting an animation should play, however due to time we were unable to solve the bug that kept this from happening. 
                Another feature we would love to implement would be a definitive "Game Won" condition. 
                Currently our game just counts the days to see how far the player can make it. 
                It would be nice if the player had a goal such as "survive for 10 days to escape." 
                Finally, a larger map so the player can explore and build larger more defensible structures. 
                The current map is limited and if the random drops of items favor the player, the player can wall off most off the map with barriers and torches. 
                An honorable mention would be an upgrade menu where a player can decide between trading gold for better movement and abilities or holding onto it for a higher score.

                We are proud of our work and satisfied with the game we produced. 
                This was an excellent class and making a satisfying game with nearly no knowledge in game development within ten weeks was a exciting experience.
